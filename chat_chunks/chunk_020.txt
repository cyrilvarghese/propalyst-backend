The Convention Committee will now focus on the Bus to Happiness.. Err.. HYDERABAD, the Speakers, the Sponsorships and a myriad more arrangements while the Membership Drive and CMJ will continue to do their good work.
We will revert with periodic updates but for now it's two beautiful words of gratitude to all.

[12/05/19, 6:50:49 PM] Samir Arora-President- NAR 🇮🇳: Dear Friends
Many Associations across the country requested an extension in the Registration Date for 11th NAR Convention to be held at Hyderabad on 24 and 25 Aug 2019.
The Convention Committee has decided to extend the Early Bird Offer till 31st May 2019 but also decided to skip the 2nd Slab and go straight to 3rd Slab rate from June 1st 2019 which will be Rs 2000 more than the Early Bird Offer.
No further extension is a surity.
This gives all of you another 20 days to get another 125 Registrations from CREA (I) and make us the largest contingent outside of Hyderabad.
Rock on Team CREA (I). Best wishes.

Samir Arora
Convention Co-Chairman.
