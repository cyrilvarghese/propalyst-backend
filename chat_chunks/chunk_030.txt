[15/03/20, 9:15:00 AM] CREA (I) MEMBERS: Agree. Some hard steps need to be taken.
[15/03/20, 9:41:55 AM] ~ Anjan Banerji: I hope members do not take it otherwise but I feel, just a simple reminder is all that is required. Please let us not become so rude to members. Somebody commits a mistake we come down like a ton of bricks. That’s not how we should treat our own community members. Let’s just remind the relevant member and ask them to delete the message. Keep it simple and respectful.
[15/03/20, 9:45:38 AM] Pankaj Golden-Nest-Agent: Many members have been immediately sending a message as soon as someone sends a message not following guidelines no one is being rude , mistakes do happen and when informed the member can delete for all .

[15/03/20, 9:48:56 AM] Pankaj Golden-Nest-Agent: *IMPORTANT NOTE & GUIDELINES*

*YOUR CREA(I) WHATSAPP GROUP POSTINGS* 

Inspite of our repeated requests for our members to strictly adhere to our WhatsApp group Guidelines, some are either not aware of it or just do not follow.

For the benefit of our members in particular and as an Association in general, we highlight once again the following guidelines to be strictly followed while posting messages in *Your CREA (I) WhatsApp group.*

1) *TIMINGS FOR POSTINGS*
        
        Strictly 8.00 AM to 9.00 PM

2) *WHAT TO POST*

      Only messages related to Real Estate and should be consolidated as one at a time.

3) *PHOTOS*

Maximum of 2 photos related to Real Estate inventories and no photos/videos of builders/Developers projects as a backdrop or in the interest of promoting their projects as a whole.

Members are requested to strictly follow the above guidelines and *VIOLATION* of it will invite delisting from the Group for a Week and repeat of it for 2 weeks.

Please Cooperate.

Regards,

Manager-CREA (I)
[15/03/20, 9:51:05 AM] ~ Anjan Banerji: Pankaj we need to mind our words. Being hurtful by asking for strict action is not desirable I feel. I would not like to stir any controversy but I feel being respectful and using kind words work better. After all we all make mistakes. But we still are a family. God bless you. I am closing the discussion from my end but by all means the discussion might continue. Have a great Sunday !
[15/03/20, 10:02:57 AM] Pankaj Golden-Nest-Agent: Guidelines posted above made by Crea-I and going forward let moderator update rather than a few of us who try and reach out to our family member to inform them of their mistake of posting 👍
[15/03/20, 10:12:25 AM] Pradeep-Joe-CREAI: Anjan , good morning. CREA (I) has always been a family. I understand, but then you should also realise if we do not correct ourselves inspite of repeated postings from our admin, you suggest a way out!! We have always been recognised as an organisation who has been following strict norms , until and unless we as a responsible member should think twice before posting wether it’s a related subject, yes mistakes happen and we do see that , the least we can do is delete it immediately, anyways I don’t want to escalate on this further, my request is please read the content before posting and make sure it’s the right content , otherwise imagine if each member starts posting irrelevant subjects and tomorrow you yourself will ask the same question!! Hence my request let’s put this conversation to an end and concentrate on our business of real estate !! Happy networking to our members !! Have a wonderful Sunday!!
[15/03/20, 10:17:26 AM] ~ SPECTRA FINANCIAL CONSULTANTS PVT LTD: Wish there is a way to automatically switch to ONLY ADMIN CAN POST from 9.00 p.m to 8.00 a.m.

[19/03/20, 6:46:56 PM] Samir Arora-President- NAR 🇮🇳: Friends
Tough times are here and we may have to brace ourselves for tougher times , ahead.
The prevailing situation with pandemic Virus globally, demands that we first protect and cater to the health & well being of ourselves , our loved ones, you and your loved ones. The monetary impact is bound to hit all, especially in logistic based Industry like ours. But all of us, individually and together will have to deal with it, albeit later.
The truth is No Realtor is Virus Proof or a Non Carrier of Virus. The more people you connect with, the more the chances of you carrying the Virus to your loved ones. Precaution is not enough. Isolation is a must. Working from Home digitally, using technology is the only short term solution. Long term solutions will emerge.
It's not bravery anymore if you are out, working and not distancing socially. It is nothing to be proud of. You may or may not catch the Virus but you could still be a carrier. You may even have the immunity to survive it but someone dear to you who is old, unwell, has asthama, diabetes or heart ailment will surely not survive the virus if infected. Would you be able to live with that guilt ever ? 
Would you rather not bounce back and face a financial challenge after this Virus mayhem is over rather than risk lives ?
Even if some of you are still not willing to listen to self isolation and lockdown advise, at least don't publicise that you are working and brave because one case spreading the Virus will spoil the Industry name. 
I have taken a hit, closed my office and whatever little possible, given Work from Home to all my colleagues and staff. That s me. You choose for yourself. Whatever way, Stay safe.
Love, Prayers and Wishes to you and all your loved ones. 🙏

NB : For a change I am penning is just another Member or CREA (I) and not as President and hence this may please be taken as my personal request and not Committee opinion. The Committee will Video meet in near future and surely we will all fight the Industry scenario together in times to come.

Thank you. 🙏

[20/03/20, 7:54:11 PM] Bhavesh Embassy-CREAI-Agent: Dear CREA colleagues,
Due to the troubles in economy, a lot of builders are delaying payments and are unable to give clarity on when can they disburse, including some of those builders who had come to us and committed to pay within a month. I am sure a lot of us who are in primary market are facing same issues. Although, we are with the builders in these tough times, Can we, CREA as a combined force, take this up for its members? Another broker organisation of the city is working on same lines to speak to builders and get advance cheques as Surety from builders for its members outstandings- so its as good as a confirmation that they will pay in future. I would like to hear from the members on their opinion about the same.
[20/03/20, 8:28:04 PM] ~ C Singh: Completely agree Bhavesh. I am facing the same issue with some of the top Grade A builders in getting the payments released along with rigrous follow ups and huge perseverance in successfully getting the payments with few other builders. Really not sure if we deserve to go through all this after having given business to these builders.
[20/03/20, 8:40:53 PM] Aman-CREAI-Agent: Shriram took 1.3 years after escalating many times got payment
[20/03/20, 8:42:39 PM] Aman-CREAI-Agent: I am sorry..time is 8pm. I missed out timeline😱
[20/03/20, 8:44:32 PM] ~ Ashish Agarwal: Dear Bhavesh
Not only due to troubles in economy. Instead builders like Pionier developers not releasing our payment from past 7 months and now they even stopped picking out calls and neither replying over email and whatsapp.
Instead I’ve got reply from one of CREA committee member that if you can’t wait for payment till they release then you can go ahead and do whatever you can.
So talking about advance cheque’s won’t workout

[21/03/20, 9:33:57 AM] Shantaram-Good Deals Realty-Director: And one more issue  is when we raise the invoice we need to pay the GST within 45 days even before we get the brokerage.  if the builder doesn't pay  the GST  paid will not be refunded.

[21/03/20, 9:40:23 AM] Aman-CREAI-Agent: Sobha is one of the worst Developer in making payment.
Once I started following up after 3 months of raising invoice but no luck of getting answer. One day copied to MD then they woke up asking submission of docs again as previous sales guy left.
Submitted again but still no luck.
Raised concern during CP event, till now they just asking one by one docs again Adhar card then PAN Card...I am still forwarding same mails with docs earlier sent 5 times earlier.

It's better to continue doing resell and no worries about cash flow instead of promoting such Developers. I would suggest and request Respected MC to take such issues with Developers. Let's boycott such Developers. If they feel we can't survive if we don't sell their properties it's not like that.

[21/03/20, 9:44:36 AM] Samir Arora-President- NAR 🇮🇳: Dear Bhavesh, Kshitij, Ashish and All CREA (I) Members,

First and Foremost, we hope all of you and your families Stay Safe through this Global Pandemic.
Times are Tough. Will get tougher with the Global Recession that is bound to impact all of the Economy and not just Real Estate. The positive side is once this Crisis is over in next few weeks ( We hope sooner than later ), Everyone would come hungrier and saner for business and a robust world will emerge, eventually.

Your concerns are very valid. Please send your outstanding details to Grievance Cell at CREA (I) via email . Our Chairman, Vice-Chairman and myself will look into it personally and take all appropriate action and representation.

However, I would like to make a request for all to understand and appreciate. At this juncture, with a Global Health Crisis looming large and Businesses largely shut, the *Fear of the Unknown* is gripping all and Developers are no different from anyone else. It is not the right time to demand payments with everyone's businesses, including Developers and ours in dire straits.
It is important to value it. There is a right time, right place & a right forum to address these and I personally request all to keep patience over the next few weeks to tide over Life existence crisis first and then address Financial issues. I hope you all agree.
CREA (I) has, does and will continue to support all our Members and will resolve issues with all Developers for all our Members on the other side of this Virus crisis.

I would also request to take individual payment issues offline and write to manager@creaindia.in to enable it reach the Grievance cell and us.
Our Chairman Pradeep Joe has personally helped many of you in past and assures to help you resolve these issues in future too at an appropriate time.

Thank you all. Stay Safe.

President
[21/03/20, 9:51:21 AM] Aman-CREAI-Agent: Much appreciated and many thanks Samir ji. I don't forget all of you helped me whereas Sheriff Sir scheduled a meeting with Divyashree director, also he has taken time out on Friday..it's Namaaz Day and got my issue resolved.
I avoid taking such issues to MC as they are also having their own businesses and difficult every time to help on such issues.
We can formalize some processes where on quarterly basis or half yearly basis such complaints can be compiled and office bearer can send those complains to respective Developers.
[21/03/20, 9:59:31 AM] Samir Arora-President- NAR 🇮🇳: Thanks Aman.

Grievance cell and we will address issues on emails even now to Developers. Request All to Please make case history and send via email.

However, I will personally meet the Developers where there are multiple members payments issues post this VIRUS crisis and resolve the issues. That's a promise. 

Now, I want the group to move to Positivity as there is dearth of it in these grim times. Let me start by wishing all of you A Very Happy *World Realtors Day* today on behalf of all Committee Members at CREA (I). 
Can each one of you share one positive message here and a Social Media Post as a Proud Realtor and as a Proud Member of CREA (I) and NAR-INDIA on the WRD today 21st March 2020.

[21/03/20, 10:25:03 AM] AA Sherrif --V-Chairman CREAI: This news is shocking to me . When Bhavesh spoke to me with his grievances I had personally taken up the issue with Mr Jaishankar of Adarsh and he had assured to resolve this payment . 

He did make a request since the markets were going a little stiff he would do so in about a month , 

we spend a lot of time taking time off to meet them at their respective office and do the follow up , we don’t need any appreciation , but the least a gratitude of the efforts made to ensure our members are protected under the umbrella of CREA(I) . 

I personally spoke to Bhavesh about this.

Inspite of our best efforts in addressing his issue, 

it is not right for Bhavesh to raise this issue again on Members network.

CREA and it's committee members have always stood by us and have helped us to resolve and expedite all our genuine concerns with the builder fraternity. I was overwhelmed to see the help, cooperation and extended support which I received from Mr. Pradeep Joe when he personally took up my concerns with Mantri Developers and hopefully my payments should get released soon. I would truly appreciate this and would thank CREA for all its help. Proud to be a CREA member!!!

[21/03/20, 12:05:01 PM] Bhavesh Embassy-CREAI-Agent: Hi Sheriff sir. I am highly obliged that you did speak to Adarsh Group and got a commitment that they will pay by next month. However there are many more developers like this and rather than bothering you individually for all those, my question was towards everyone if others are also facing the same issue with specific developers- in that case a collective push will work in interest of all members. I know that CREA (I) has gone out of the way to fight for its members- infact what you did for Aman with Divyashree on a Friday afternoon was inspiring. However I think all members should know which developers are defaulting in last 6-8 months so everyone else stays safe! As Sameer Arora sir (who I also consider as one of my mentors) said, Times are tough and we can only wade through these tough waters together with holding each other’s hand.

[25/03/20, 10:25:07 AM] Samir Arora-President- NAR 🇮🇳: Dear CREA (I) Members & Friends,

Stay Home. Stay Safe.
Difficult times, but This too shall pass and We shall overcome, together.

I am sure, the senior Mentors on this group will revert with their wisdom for all of us to learn but here is my humble submission of suggestions on how to utilise the abundant time effectively

1. Learn one new skill online, everyday. If this lasts 2q days, you could be equipped with 21 skills to come back stronger in your business. It could be Digital Marketing, Documentation, Valuation or any subjects of your choice.

2. Utilise the Time to organise your data in a manner it is easy to mine tomorrow. Excel, CRM, whatever works.

3. Grow one skill outside of your daily work. Pursue it as a passion. The one that becomes your personal motivator.

4. Eat a Frog. Yes, Eat a frog is a terminology to take up one mammoth task that you hate, fear or dislike in your work. For example if one is Tech scared or Social Media scared, start, experiment and master it in this break.

5. Reach out to your clients. Don't even attempt to sell Real Estate as no one in this Environment wants to even think of investment. Ask them, How are they and what they think you can do to help in this situation as a group post the lockdown are over ? 
Any humane touch digitally will help your work tomorrow.

I am thinking a few more but I am sure many of us will kick-start and contribute more and newer ideas, now.🙏

Once again, Wishing you all a Happy Ugadi and safe times ahead.

There are more than 500 knowledgeable and spiritual Thanthries in KERALA and South India  who are planning to sit in their houses and pray to the Mother Goddess from evening  *6.30 PM onwards* for one hour. 

This is for the protection of the individual, families, countries and the whole Universe. It is the love, protection and blessings of the Mother Goddess which have come to the aid of humanity always.

This is an invitation to ALL human beings who believe that jointly praying will aid all the practical and medical efforts to fight the Covid 19 virus. Those who know the *Lalitha Sahasranaama* can recite it continuously *for ONE HOUR from 6.30 PM, IST on SUNDAY 29th of March 2020.* Those who are unfamiliar with the Mahamanthra can recite ANY prayer to the Great Goddess Shakthi, pleading with Her to take care of Her Creation.

The Global Pandemic caused by COVID-19 has created a havoc in almost everyone's lives and we are no different at CREA (I). The times ahead are definitely not going to be easy but we are all together in this and Together we shall overcome.

The first and foremost priority is that All of us and our families sail through this safely and emerge hale and healthy to fight the next battle economically. Like our PM said, Jaan hai to Jahaan hai.

Be rest assured, CREA (I) and it's Members will rise like a Phoenix again post this traumatic phase, together and the Committee will address Industry issues on War Footing basis once mobility returns to our lives.
I am sure all of you are Home. Stay Safe. 🙏
[30/03/20, 3:20:57 PM] Samir Arora-President- NAR 🇮🇳: It is very difficult for Admins to be a Monitor at this stage. Self discipline would be the best mode and Self constraint on forwards is the best approach. The GOI has directives against posting and as responsible Citizens and Members, let's follow the good practices that we have always followed.
Thank you all.

#TheLieLama

My Dear Realtors,

Stardom comes to you naturally and all of you are Stars in the Sky of Real Estate Skyscrapers. Some shine bigger than others but all of you are the Stars of this Galaxy called Real Estate Industry. Each one of you has learnt that when you light your soul and burn like a candle, you illuminate the world around you. Your associations are are a sum of the light you emit together.

Questions galore in everyone's mind at the moment, when the World and our beloved country India is undergoing a lock down due to the Global Pandemic called COVID-19. I have received many a calls and texts, all seeking advise on one query, " What does the future hold for us ?" and seeking a reply that can comfort all.

I consolidated my thoughts and here are some ( long post warning but should benefit all Realtors and Real Estate Industry Professionals and maybe even Non Industry professionals ) thoughts encapsulated together and I hope it helps.

1.  This Too Shall Pass.

Yes, it will bring the difficulties that an Economic downturn Virus brings post a pandemic, but This too shall pass. The first and foremost, in fact the only priority at the moment is to ensure that You and your loved ones remain safe and keep everyone else safe by Staying Home, Washing Hands and taking all precautions being told to us by by the Government Authorities and Medical Professionals. It is the one opportunity in life to serve the Nation and all its Citizens by just staying Home and the one time when all of us must score 100/100 in the test of testing times.

2.  Difficult Times bring Opportunities Galore

Businesses and Entrepreneurs have success stories that catapulted them to a growth path post an economic downturn have one common denominator. They were prepared and they smelt the opportunity. This is a golden time to hone your skills, learn and master the art of what you feared. It may be Digital Marketing, Social Media Marketing. AI, Documentation, Real Estate domain knowledge, Marketing skills, New technologies, etc. This is the time to strengthen your domain expertise and add new skills by fighting the demons that were not your domain. Residential Realtors can learn more about Commercial Real Estate and vice versa and Local City Operators can use the time to Network across Cities to be prepared for an all India business or multi city business. Key is, Identify, Learn, Master and Prepare yourself for Tomorrow.

3.  Do NOT worry about the Macros. Focus on the Micros.

The Financial markets will tumble. The large Corporate will take time to bounce back. There will be Job losses. There will be instability for a bit. In this immediate aftermath period, do not forget, the whole world will align to the new Reality. Our Industry Realty is always aligned to the existing Reality. Rentals will move. End Users will buy Homes as Home post this phase will be the most valued possession. Investors will probably wait it out. The prices will in fact go up as Cost of Construction and Finance will go up. The Sales will be lower for those who do not re orient. The Sales will Zoom for those who are prepared and align to the New Normal. Low value Housing will be high demand. Commercial Real Estate will cool a bit but will align in multi investor pattern. All in All, Every client will know that It will be a good time to Invest. As always, some will miss the boat. Identifying the right property and right client and being an Advisory will be the new Norm. Relationship Marketing will Win, Hands down.

4.  Cross Selling via Collaborations and New Domains 

Collaborations and Cross selling Products, Projects across Territories will be the new normal. Your Competitor will be your best collaborator. Work on building the ideas and relationship now and devise a strategy to launch yourself across domains already penned earlier. Collaboration, Not Competition is the way forward. Complementing partners across domains with different skill sets and domain specializations will be the Key to Success.

5.  Learn Swimming, yet again.

Yes, Learn to Swim in the Economic scenario, yet again. Post the lock down and expected staggered opening of the markets, For the first 3 months, learn to splash and keep afloat by doing Basics. Do not attempt to gun for Olympic Gold straightaway. Identify opportunities, use your learning and build on it. 
Next 3 months, focus on speed along with the basics by going out to a wider market with a strategy in place. Practice and Learn quickly from the feedback from the Coaches ( Clients ). Implement the changes.
6 months later, Go for the Gold. You will emerge a Champ. A Champ that each one of us in the Industry will be proud of.

As of now focus on the Championship of Life.
Stay Positive but Test Negative at any point of time.
As our Honourable PM said, "Jaan hai to Jahan hai"

All Real Estate Agents/Brokers , Join a city/state Real Estate Association and via the local association join National Association of Realtors-India. Unity is Strength and we all need to be Stronger than ever before. All Realtors of CREA (I) and NAR-INDIA, you are the Pride of the Industry and Together, I am sure, We will overcome.

Together, let us Light the Candle of Hope at 9 pm on 5th April.
And Create Light for our own soul and fraternity besides paying homage to the departed souls and pray for strength to bereaved families who have lost a loved one to this deadly COVID-19.

Lets say together at 9 pm tomorrow from our homes.
WE SHALL OVERCOME, together.

[09/04/20, 12:25:30 PM] ‪+91 98458 69886‬: Do you think that everything will be normal and calm down after 21 days' home stay?

*****************************

A very important article by Dr. Vijay Goswami

Actual fight will start from the 22nd day.
Are you ready?
What is going to happen on 22nd day????

Give full attention, do not get panicked, read and think.

When the lockdown is lifted on 22nd day....

The way people behaved during janata curfew, they will come out with national flags in hand, sing patriotic songs and shouting slogans that we have won the war and we are part of a great nation. But they all forget that we have not destroyed the virus completely, we have tried to control it.

The so called intellectuals will on 22nd day go to theaters, restaurants, malls, gardens. They will ignore the fact that we have to maintain social distancing as virus is still there.

All small, medium businesses and corporate houses will start working as per their original schedule, not only that but to finish the pending work they will work overtime in double shifts by engaging their employees for extra hours, which will spread the virus in a big way.

The labour force, like your servants, drivers, maids, who went away to their villages, will return rapidly for their daily wages. Out of these thousands even one person has the virus and not tested or treated will carelessly roam around thereby spreading the virus and the chain will start again.

All the public transport like, bus, train, will be crowded and the spread of the chain of the virus will activate.

Entire India will forget that we are in the middle of this global calamity of pendemic. Everyone will forget about masks, sanitizers and personal hygiene because they feel that after 21 days we have found the remedy of the virus.

No, it is not like that.

This is the reason that there are every possibility to spread the virus again like a forest fire.

If you do not trust me, check the statistics of 2009 H1N1 Swine flu.

The 21 day Quarantine will be completely useless if we do not educate people technically that what we must do from 22nd day onwards,failing which there is every possibility of further lockdown which will paralyze our economy.

What we can do from the 22nd day?

We must work intelligently.

From 22nd day we should not go to parties, public places and avoid gathering in a crowd.

Continuously maintain all the warnings and instructions which you have been following for last four weeks.

Please remember, this is not the end of virus but the beginning of the end.

We should wake up people who are not going to read this article about the effects of the virus.

The people around you are all Indians and if ALL remain vigilant then we will conquer this pandemic. Remember this and ensure that all follow these guidelines.

I am trying to see that this message reaches to the government and see that we together fight from the 22nd day about the social distancing.

We can bring a big difference in the life of 130 crores Indians if we understand the seriousness of this critical situation by jointly in one voice.
Take care

[09/04/20, 7:18:16 PM] Shiv Kumar RR-Nagar-Agent: Real Estate study :- 

*Real Estate to 
BOOM after 
Covid-19 mayhem....*

It is quite evident that the global economy has already entered into a great recession. Super power like Italy, America will be worst affected. Almost all the industries-Travel and Tourism, Automobile, White Goods, IT, Retail etc are suffering huge losses and there is no ray of hope soon. 

Amid all these heart wrenching news, there is a brighter side of it for India, specially *Indian Real Estate* market.
As the whole world seems to have lost control, India is doing far better and has managed to contain the pandemic so far.


_*Why will Indian Real Estate grow?*_
1.	The whole world has lost its faith and trust in China.
2.	Americans/Australians have started hating Chinese people and soon it will stop using any product / service connected to China. There will be a complete boycott.
3.	The only option left for the whole world would be India, which provides most skilled manpower at the lowest cost.
4.	Stock Exchanges / Gold are no more a Safe option for Investment.
5.	Indian Government and Banks to Infuse large amount of Money for economic revival.
6.	India will overcome this crisis much earlier than most of the countries.
7.	India Inc is all set to grab this opportunity. Make in India, Startup India etc will give an extra push.
8.	Commercial Spaces (Offices/Retail) will eventually see a spike in demand.
9.	As the reverse Migration from America and other countries will soon start happening, it will lead to a great demand in Premium Residential Apartments.
10.	Northern India has a Majority Share in NRI population.
11.	Lockdown will leave everyone with a desire to have bigger living space, therefore, most of the Occupants would look for better residential space. (1 bhk to 2/3 bhk, Flats to Villas, Villas to Farmhouses)
12.	This un-paralleled demand in Real Estate is foreseen by many experts and it obviously makes it a lucrative deal for Investors as well as end user. 
13.	Expected ROI could be seen at appx. *1.7 X (almost 2 times) for residential and 1.5X for commercial* within _*3-5 yrs*_ time. However, Rentals will see a temporary corrections in the Metro / Urban Cities.
14.	India will become the Manufacturing and Export hub (Like China) in next 5 yrs. Which would create a huge Jobs.
Please Share it with all the concerned people in the real estate Industry.

All the best to construction 🏗 community  💐

*Stay Safe, Stay Apart and Yet Stay Bonded*
That was the Theme we wanted to start the CREA (I) Events, Trainings & Interactions on Zoom in this lockdown.

We have the feedback from many members of Friday being not suitable for this session. Hence our Events Team has moved the Teamwork Event to *Monday , 13th April at 12 noon*
Your presence is valuable and we hope to see at least 250 plus Members join the Event if not all. We will try to ensure Events & Trainings are kept on non festival days.

There are more Trainings that will follow and our Secretary Santosh will send out the links for Registration.

Stay Safe and See you all soon, Zooming up.

[14/04/20, 3:00:01 PM] Aman-CREAI-Agent: Below is the brief from meeting addressed by Deepak Parekh. 
Brief note from Deepak Parekh’s Webinar 
Current Scenario – Analysis & Business Response
1. Conserve, Cash at all Costs, you will need it for unforeseen circumstances, including another lock down.
2. Make Team A & B. Team A studies prepares current response, and Team B works on situation after two years.
3. You will have to increase wages for some workers to incentivize them to come back. Getting people back will be a problem
4. Travel sector will be hit for a very long time. 2 years plus.
5. 9 Months of this year will be gone in recovery in normalcy in terms of Operations coming back
to normal. If there is no other pandemic.
6. Cut Costs, Reduce Salaries, Prune Manpower if needed.
7. Increase equity in the company. Better to be over capitalized is better than to be over leveraged.
Being Over leveraged will be a disaster, avoid the debt trap at all costs. Give a discount, let investors make money. Get Private Equity. Singapore Airlines is doing a Rights issue as we speak.
8. Micro finance will be worst hit, amongst NBFCs.
9. Build relationship and trust with the banks. Don’t move relationships for a quarter or half a
percent.
10. Await announcement for MSME. More incentives and support expected.
11. Real Estate: Land is a state subject, Real Estate Prices will come down by 20% at least.
Developers who have bought land at high prices will to take a hit on the projects. Many companies will go bankrupt. MCHI – Credai must talk to the Govt for a one time restructuring like in 2008. It will take 8-9 months for things to normalize for Real Estate.
12. Payments from Govt is a big issue. Lot of litigation
Macroeconomic Factors & Risks, Long term Outlook:
1. Govt has agreed to increase Fiscal Deficit which is a good sign. State Govts getting Overdraft facilities from Central Government.
2. Consumer Credit is 13% as a percentage of GDP, where as China is 40% and USA 80%
3. Mortgage to GDP, India: 10%, China: 26%, Thailand 20%, Scandinavia: 90% USA: 70%. India
needs to reach the 12-15% mark in the coming couple of years.
4. Yes Bank on Path on recovery, Should have taken part in a similar manner for ILFS and Jet
Airways.
5. USA 10 year paper is 0.77%, India is 6%. India is at a BBB (Lowest Investment Grade). If we
get graded down we will become a Junk Bond .This will crash the economy. This is also why it
will be difficult to print money.
6. Interest rates will go down further, but Banks must pass it on to the company. RBI lends only to
the Banks in India and Banks are concerned more about their own Balance Sheet than national
interest. RBI must start buying Company Bonds.
7. Middle-East will be in a big trouble. Oil will not go back to 60-70. Oil will be at 40-50.
8. Expect more deglobalization. European countries have already made it mandatory for Govt
approval for all acquisition, as companies are available cheap and there is a fear that China may
look to take over companies in Europe.
9. Rupee will be under pressure. Look at a minimum 3% depreciation YoY of the rupee even in the
best times. We are doing much better at the moment with 10% depreciation (Many are at 25%). Trouble will ensue only if our rating goes to Junk. Our Rating unfortunately has not gone up even in our Best Years of 8% growth. However, Companies are getting good borrowing rates. Exports will have to grow for India to do better. Expect a package for Export soon from the Government.
10. By 2023 390 million people will come into the middle class. Hence investment will come. Only 2% of Indians are invested in Equity. Equity investors will increase. India Mutual fund to GDP

ratio is 12% where as in Mexico etc. are 60% plus and USA 100%. India needs to move to 20%.
Rising middle class will lead to more investments in Real Estate and Equity in the long term.
11. Savings rate in India is 17% (Earlier 30%). 10% out of that is in Real Estate or Golds etc. Liquid Savings rate is 7%. People in India are getting used to consumption in India. So there is no
stress there. Hopeful that consumption will increase.
12. EPFO should be allowed to invest in equity. They invested in IL&FS and made a loss. So it is
more conservative.
13. There is a medicine (Cure) which is under testing in the USA, which hopefully should be out in
the market by June end if FDA approves. Vaccine (preventive) will take time.

[14/04/20, 3:19:37 PM] ~ Mohammed Faraaz: This should be shared with the government and ask them to reduce guideline values by 25%.
[14/04/20, 3:22:20 PM] ~ Sourish: He clarified 20% on ready to move in inventory..That's to help Developers for liquidity..Also on RTM stock developers need to pay taxes and deemed rental hence he said it's better to sell those off..
[14/04/20, 6:18:22 PM] Ashwin-Creai-Lands: Very well written Sir!! Is it a typo that you have mentioned an upsurge in prices by last quarter of 2021, instead of 2020 or was it exactly the time frame you think the upsurge would happen?

[22/04/20, 5:30:52 PM] Vasu Jain-CBD Agent - BRH: Dear Team Crea, 
can we get the recording of today's zoom meet. Couldnt be a part of the discussion coz of connectivity issue.
[22/04/20, 5:32:54 PM] Mani Octopus Realty Agent: Yes, please. Kindly share the recorded version.
[22/04/20, 5:33:01 PM] ~ K S Joseph: I guess towards the end of the discussion there was some mention of it being shared on some site, couldn't hear it clearly coz of network issues
[22/04/20, 6:11:39 PM] Ashwin-Creai-Lands: What an awesome interaction between top minds of the real estate industry👏👏

Great insights and facts put out by Ravi Varma Sir, Vijay Garg, Tarun Bhatia and our own chief - President Samir Arora. 

Sharing a few takeaways for the benefit of those who could not attend;

1. Repo rates and home loans could be slashed further to support RE industry and banks could lend higher amounts at cheaper rates to credible developers, boosting development.
2. NRI investments will see a boom as dollar rate goes up and metros will be the beneficiary.
3. Metro dwelling folks will want to invest in their respective hometowns as COVID has created the need to have a home with all basic amenities, in their respective hometowns.These 2 segments will boost metro residential sales and tier 2 town residential sales upwards.
3. 3BHK and larger units are seeing a 20% greater demand as “Home” turns into the new office or fortress.
4. India’s GDP is still pegged at 1.9% by IMF as against 1% projected growth of China and with many multinationals moving in, commercial office spaces will be in demand by end of this year.
5. Retail commercial spaces will see a drastic price correction in both sale and rental prices. 
6. While America is trying to cut down job losses for its citizens, there may be an Influx of NRI’s returning to India, wanting good homes. 
7. 250 million rural citizens are moving towards cities creating a need for greater affordable housing options.
8. Luxury real estate has seen an upward trend of 20% as people who do not require finance or were sitting on the fence, have made up their minds to buy that dream house now.
9. Residential units which have a study and a “Maid quarters” may come into bigger demand.
10. Credible and reputed developers may not lower prices as constructions costs are only going up. They may come up with various offers to help people buy homes.
11. Low budget housing could be affected over the next 6-8 months as job losses seem prevailing in the blue collar sector.
12. Home locations could be preferred in remote areas away from town centres and crowded places changing entire town planning strategies.
13. UP govt has started online registrations and other governments may follow the same procedures.
14. 30-60 lakh homes are the key sector to watch out for as they are mostly bought by govt employees who are unlikely to be affected by Covid.
15. The real estate industry hopes the govt to exempt 2nd home from income tax obligation, provide affordable land parcels to build affordable housing projects, better response(as already seen now) towards industry as our industry contributes towards 8% GDP and 18% employment of the country, while also supporting 250 auxiliary industries.

Lastly, a realtor has to move towards technology as clients will rely 80% on technology to see a property and 20% physically to do a final site visit. We also need to invest on upgrading our skills and technology so that we can store our data on cloud and be able to work from anywhere, while showcasing properties through digital walkthroughs to clients. 

Remember that you just need to convince your client that this is the best time to buy that 1st or 2nd home as prices will never be this cheap ever again.

Kindly pardon the long message🙏

Thank you Joe and Samir for giving us this global platform which teaches us to learn and earn at the same time🙏😊
[22/04/20, 6:17:12 PM] Samir Arora-President- NAR 🇮🇳: Thank you everyone for your continuos support and unconditional encouragement always.

[09/05/20, 1:32:36 PM] Aman-CREAI-Agent: Dear Friends 
I would be requesting help from our MC to help me getting my payment from Sobha held up for more than 1.5 years. Meanwhile, I would like to know on below.
1. Is anyone else experiencing the similar issue with Sobha Developers.

2. There is another issue coming up after RERA. Initially builders allow us to raise invoice after Agreement is done. Now Agreement is done on 10% payment. I recently raised invoice to Provident and received a response that client has paid only 10%. 
Here, how do we track when builder demands for another 10% and client pays the same.
In our industry, to get our payment we need to run from pillar to post against many developers.

3. Shriram Properties committed to pay me Rs 50k penalty against delayed payment 2 years back but till now not paid and keeping quiet.

At the same time, they are sending 2 demand notes to client who booked property in Blue during COVID time and gave only 7 days time to make a payment else threatened to charge penalty.

4. Purva , I do not have any issue with them but have concern as a investor and also unable to show face to existing clients because I got couple of deals done in Palm Beach and Westend. Investors wanted to sell their flat but they are not allowing to show and pushing client for registration. There is a concept of transfer fee still no luck. Client asked for help , but I could not.
Existing clients are the one who give us 60 to 70% business but because of such practices from Developers clients are losing faith on Developers specially Investors.

Please advise. I think we need to get United and bring such concerns to CREDAI.

Thanks
