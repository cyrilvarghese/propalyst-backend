Generate a JSON CSS extraction schema for MagicBricks property listings from https://www.magicbricks.com/. Use 'baseSelector' to target the repeating card elements (.mb-srp__card), and 'fields' array to extract property details (title, price, location, bedrooms, bathrooms, area, facing, parking, furnishing, description, agent name, agent rating, posted_date, photo_count). For each label-value pair field, use text content matching to find the label and extract its sibling value element. For property_url, extract from the script tag with type="application/ld+json" - this contains JSON-LD data with a "url" field that will be parsed by the scraper's post-processor.
