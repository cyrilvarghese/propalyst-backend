Your task is to GENERATE a JSON CSS extraction schema for https://www.magicbricks.com/ property listings.

DO NOT extract data from the HTML. Instead, analyze the HTML structure and CREATE a schema that describes HOW to extract data.

The schema must have this structure:
{
  "baseSelector": "CSS selector for the repeating property card container",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "field_name",
      "selector": "CSS selector relative to baseSelector",
      "type": "text|attribute|html"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Required fields to include in your schema:
- title: Property heading/title
- price: Rental/sale price amount
- location: Area/locality name
- bedrooms: Number of BHK/rooms
- bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
- area: Carpet area or built-up area
- furnishing: Furnishing type (furnished/semi/unfurnished)
- facing: Property facing direction
- floor: Floor number information
- balcony: Number of balconies
- parking: Parking availability
- amenities: Key features/amenities list
- description: Full property description text
- agent_name: Agent or owner name
- agent_rating: Agent rating if available

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - Text Content-Based Selectors (NOT position-based):
For ALL label-value pair fields (Parking, Washroom, Carpet Area, Furnishing Status, Cabins, Seats, Pantry):
- DO NOT use nth-child, nth-of-type, or any position-based selectors
- INSTEAD, generate selectors that find the LABEL element by its TEXT CONTENT, then extract the adjacent VALUE sibling
- The label elements contain text like: "Parking", "Washroom", "Carpet Area", "Furnishing Status", etc.
- Pattern to follow: Find element with specific label text, then navigate to sibling value element
- Example selector structure:
  * Find .mb-srp__card__summary--label or .mb-srp__card__summary-commercial--label by text content
  * Get the sibling .mb-srp__card__summary--value or .mb-srp__card__summary-commercial--value
  * Result: A selector that matches "Parking" label and extracts its adjacent value
- This ensures fields match by semantic meaning (label text), not by position

For NESTED column items (Cabins, Seats):
- These appear within .mb-srp__card__summary-commercial--column containers
- Find the column containing the label with specific text (e.g., "Cabins", "Seats")
- Extract the value from that same column

Instructions:
1. Examine the MagicBricks HTML structure carefully
2. Find the repeating container that wraps each property card (baseSelector)
3. For EACH label-value pair field, identify:
   - The label element and its exact text content (examples: "Parking", "Washroom", "Carpet Area", "Cabins", "Seats")
   - The adjacent value element that contains the field data
4. Generate selectors that check the TEXT CONTENT of labels and navigate to their values:
   - For "Parking": Generate a selector that finds the label text "Parking" and gets its sibling value
   - For "Washroom": Generate a selector that finds the label text "Washroom" and gets its sibling value
   - For "Cabins": Generate a selector within .mb-srp__card__summary-commercial--column that finds "Cabins" label
5. For nested items, include the parent container (.mb-srp__card__summary-commercial--column) in selector logic
6. Return ONLY the JSON schema - no explanation or additional text
7. Make selectors as specific as possible to avoid false matches
8. Ensure selectors work for multiple properties even if label order or structure changes
